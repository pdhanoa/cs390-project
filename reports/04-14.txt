My CHI My Future Project

	•	Goals for Next Week
	⁃	Understand the stakeholder’s goals
	⁃	Break down the big questions into smaller parts 
	⁃	Roadmap some forms of EDA to potentially provide insights and findings to answer these questions
	⁃	
	•	Questions to Explore
	⁃	What metrics can we use to judge how well a program is doing?
	⁃	What kinds of things are correlated with program use?
	⁃	Proportion of different programs
	⁃	Stratify by age range and population of neighborhood
	⁃	Which are the least served neighborhoods?
	⁃	Geographical 
	⁃	Long/Lat to determine how dense/sparse programs are
	⁃	Engineer variables: Paid participation / Scholarships given out
	⁃	Transportation + Food
	⁃	Correlation between Good transportation vs. program count & participation rate
	⁃	Seasonal Trends + Time of Day
