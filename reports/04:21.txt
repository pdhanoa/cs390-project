My CHI My Future Project

Progress

- Parveen: 
	- Investigated ways to plot neighborhood data on a geospatial map
	- Merge shape data w/ neighborhood data 
	- Group data to find per neighborhood to see how many programs
	- Assume programs run every year w/o turnover ratio
	- EDAs and visualizations (Free food, transportation) to detect massive class imbalance

-Arielle:
	- Created new variables to provide more implications and significance (Run during the weekends, weekdays or both? Interrupt the work day? Measure is accessibility)
	- Data Cleaning: Temporal data is string

-Chen
	- Focused on collecting outside data, especially the ones that detail the characteristics of different community areas and neighborhoods
	- Collected information from several sources to represent the equity and accessibility of different neighborhoods


Questions to Investigate / Task

-Parveen:
	- Percentage of programs in a  given neighborhood that is on scholarship and/or provide free food, etc. (Dataframe-specific proportions given each neighborhood)

-Arielle
	- Uploading code and data to GitHub
	
-Chen:
	- Make several geographic density plots with regards to the info and characteristics of different neighborhoods in Chicago


Kaggle Dataset

- Arielle: Begin model exploration and report cross-validation scores
